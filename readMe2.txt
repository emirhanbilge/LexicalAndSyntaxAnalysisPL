In this project, we designed a lexical and syntax analysis of a language called ceng ++. We made it to experience designs in a programming language. 
The language we have created here is a mixture of JavaScript and C, and we designed it as a language that supports both static and dynamic data types. 
Thank you to my teammates Sena Yurtseven and Burcu AÄŸdara. My role in this project was the team leader responsible for design and design. Thank you to my
